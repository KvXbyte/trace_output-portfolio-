🔁 **Hashing Basics**

---

### Covered Topics:
- Purpose of hashing: verification, integrity, indexing
- One-way functions and collision resistance
- Common hash algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256
- Rainbow tables, salting, and brute-force resistance
- Use of hashing in passwords and files

---

### Key Notes:
- A **hash** is a fixed-size output from variable-length input; even tiny input changes drastically alter the output.
- **SHA-256** is a modern, strong hash function used in everything from Bitcoin to TLS.
- **Salting** prevents rainbow table attacks by introducing uniqueness.
- Hashes should never be reversible—if they are, the algorithm is broken.
