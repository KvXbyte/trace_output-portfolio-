🔐 **Cryptography Basics**

---

### Covered Topics:
- What cryptography is and why it matters
- Symmetric encryption and key sharing
- Common ciphers: Caesar, AES, DES
- Cryptographic goals: confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA)
- Importance of key length and entropy

---

### Key Notes:
- **Symmetric encryption** uses a single shared key — fast but less secure for broad distribution.
- **AES** is the current standard for symmetric encryption; it’s used in everything from Wi-Fi to full disk encryption.
- **Key size** directly affects strength — longer keys increase resistance to brute force.
- Avoid relying on **security through obscurity**; always pair algorithms with strong key management.
