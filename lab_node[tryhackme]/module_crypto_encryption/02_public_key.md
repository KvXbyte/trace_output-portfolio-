ðŸ”‘ **Public Key Cryptography Basics**

---

### Covered Topics:
- Asymmetric encryption: public/private key pairs
- Key exchange principles and challenges
- RSA algorithm fundamentals
- Use cases in SSH, TLS, and certificates
- Concepts of digital signatures and authentication

---

### Key Notes:
- **Asymmetric encryption** solves key-sharing issues by using a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
- **RSA** is widely used for secure key exchange but can be slow for large data transfers.
- **SSH authentication** uses asymmetric keys to eliminate password-based logins.
- **Digital signatures** ensure message integrity and non-repudiationâ€”vital for email, documents, and certificates.
