# 🌐 TryHackMe: Web Hacking (Export Summary)

**Track:** Web Hacking (JavaScript, SQL, Burp Suite, OWASP)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Time Spent:** ~4.5 hours  
**Environment:** Web-based attack labs on TryHackMe  
**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate

---

## 🔑 Core Takeaways

- **Web Foundations:** Learned the structure and flow of HTTP requests, responses, status codes, and headers  
- **JavaScript Awareness:** Identified how browser-side scripting opens up paths for exploitation (e.g., XSS)  
- **SQL Injection Primer:** Gained insight into query manipulation and how poor sanitization is exploited  
- **Burp Suite Familiarity:** Practiced live interception, request tampering, and attack surface mapping  
- **OWASP Threat Awareness:** Mapped common vulnerabilities (A1–A10) to real-world risk scenarios

## 💭 Reflections

This module built a practical bridge between browser behavior and security risk. It exposed how simple user inputs and predictable patterns can lead to serious vulnerabilities. Tools like Burp Suite amplified the learning by giving a live look at attack surfaces many users never realize exist.
