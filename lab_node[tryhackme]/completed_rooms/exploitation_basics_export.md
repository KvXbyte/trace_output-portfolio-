## ðŸ”‘ Core Takeaways

- **Credential Exposure**: Explored how malformed document links can bypass Protected View in Outlook and leak user NTLM hashes (CVE-2024-21413).
- **Framework Familiarity**: Developed fluency in Metasploit structure, modules, and CLI-based exploitation methods.
- **Post-Exploitation Logic**: Practiced using Meterpreter to enumerate, capture, and manage compromised systems.
- **Windows Weakness Awareness**: Hands-on exploitation of EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) in outdated Windows systems.

## ðŸ§ª Skills Practiced

| Category             | Commands / Tools / Modules                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Metasploit Usage     | `msfconsole`, `use`, `exploit`, `set`, `run`           |
| Credential Capture   | UNC path exploit, NTLMv2 harvesting                    |
| Payload Delivery     | Reverse shell setup, listener configuration            |
| Post-Exploitation    | `sysinfo`, `hashdump`, `screenshot`, `migrate`         |
| Exploit Development  | EternalBlue / MS17-010 module usage                    |

## ðŸ§  Reflections

This module provided practical exposure to the attacker mindset. Learning how tools like Metasploit operate behind the scenes made exploitation workflows more intuitiveâ€”and raised awareness of the risks of unpatched systems and weak defaults. Simulating credential leaks and post-exploitation with Meterpreter added depth to understanding lateral movement and attacker persistence.

While not Red Team focused long-term, these fundamentals help build empathy for adversary behaviorâ€”essential knowledge for defenders on the Blue or Purple team path.
