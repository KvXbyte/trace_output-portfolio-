# ğŸ“¦ completed_rooms

This folder contains refined summaries, exports, and polished reflections from completed TryHackMe rooms and learning modules.

Unlike the raw notes in `module_*` folders, entries here are treated as **clean exports**â€”useful for portfolio presentation, professional sharing, or final-stage documentation. Each file reflects key takeaways, learned skills, and personal insight.
