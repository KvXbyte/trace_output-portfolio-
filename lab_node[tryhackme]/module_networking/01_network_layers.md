# 🌐 Network Layers & Addressing

## Covered Topics:
- OSI Model (L1–L7)
- TCP/IP Stack
- IPv4 vs IPv6
- MAC addresses, DNS, and ARP
- Subnetting concepts

## Key Notes:
- Layer 3 = IP addressing; Layer 4 = TCP/UDP; Layer 7 = app-level protocols like HTTP/SMTP
- Subnetting = dividing a network into efficient segments—crucial for minimizing broadcast domains
- MAC addresses operate at Layer 2 and are permanent to devices
