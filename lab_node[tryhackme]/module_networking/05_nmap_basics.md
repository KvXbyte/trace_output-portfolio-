# ðŸ“¡ Nmap: Host & Port Discovery

## Covered Topics:
- Host discovery (`-sn`)
- Port scanning: TCP SYN, TCP Connect, UDP
- Version detection and OS fingerprinting
- Scan timing, evasion basics

## Key Notes:
- `-sS` = stealth scan; `-A` = aggressive scan with OS/version detection
- Timing options (`-T1` to `-T5`) can reduce detection but risk reliability
- Nmap is often an attackerâ€™s first toolâ€”but a defenderâ€™s early warning sign
