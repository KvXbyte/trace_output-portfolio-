# 🔁 Core Protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP

## Covered Topics:
- TCP 3-way handshake
- UDP stateless communication
- ICMP: ping, echo requests, traceroute
- ARP: IP-to-MAC resolution

## Key Notes:
- TCP = reliable, ordered, connection-oriented
- UDP = faster, but no delivery guarantees
- ICMP can be used for both diagnostics and reconnaissance
- ARP poisoning is a common attack vector in local networks
