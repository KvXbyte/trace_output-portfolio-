# Pyramid of Pain

**Focus Area:**  
Understanding attacker cost through different types of indicators.

---

## Key Points
- Indicators range from trivial (hashes) to painful (TTPs).
- Higher-level detection = more expensive for adversaries to adapt.
- Encourages prioritization of detections that disrupt attacker agility.

---

## Reflection
A clear visualization of why chasing only low-level IOCs isnâ€™t enough.  
Confirmed the value of focusing on behaviors and TTPs.
