# Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

**Focus Area:**  
Structuring incidents via four core features.

---

## Key Points
- Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, Victim (the “diamond”).
- Relationships between nodes provide investigative leads.
- Supports pivoting: e.g., Infrastructure ↔ Adversary linkages.

---

## Reflection
A flexible and visual model for structuring incident reports.  
Excited to expand this later with practical case notes in DFIR-focused work.
