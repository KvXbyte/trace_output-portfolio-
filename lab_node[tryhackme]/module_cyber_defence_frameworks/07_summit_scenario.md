# Summit Scenario

**Focus Area:**  
Hands-on purple-team simulation using the Pyramid of Pain.

---

## Key Points
- Goal: raise adversary cost until they “backed down.”
- Practical application of theoretical frameworks in detection engineering.
- Reinforced the concept that security = increasing attacker effort.

---

## Reflection
One of the most engaging rooms so far.  
Felt close to real-world SOC purple-team exercises and tied theory to practice.
