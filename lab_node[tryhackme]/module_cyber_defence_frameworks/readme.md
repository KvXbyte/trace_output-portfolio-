üõ°Ô∏è module_cyber_defence_frameworks
This module documents structured learning from the **Cyber Defence Frameworks** path on TryHackMe.  
It focuses on core models and frameworks that guide defensive strategies, including the Pyramid of Pain, Cyber Kill Chain, Unified Kill Chain, Diamond Model, and MITRE ATT&CK.  
The module also included scenario-based exercises to apply these concepts in practice.

With these rooms completed, it builds a foundational toolkit for SOC and DFIR work, combining both theory and hands-on adversary simulation.
