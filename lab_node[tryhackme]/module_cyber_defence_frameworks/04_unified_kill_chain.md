# Unified Kill Chain

**Focus Area:**  
Extended framework combining intrusion + campaign phases.

---

## Key Points
- Expands beyond the Cyber Kill Chain with more granular phases.
- Maps well to MITRE ATT&CK for detection engineering.
- Encourages defenders to think holistically about intrusion + persistence.

---

## Reflection
More complex but more realistic than the Cyber Kill Chain.  
Will be a useful anchor when cross-referencing ATT&CK techniques in GitHub later.
