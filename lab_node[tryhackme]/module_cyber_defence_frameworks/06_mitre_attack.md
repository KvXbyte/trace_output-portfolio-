# MITRE ATT&CK

**Focus Area:**  
Comprehensive library of tactics and techniques used by adversaries.

---

## Key Points
- ATT&CK = dictionary of TTPs, not a timeline.
- Best used when combined with models (Kill Chains, Diamond).
- Useful for mapping detections, adversary emulation, and reporting.

---

## Reflection
On its own, MITRE can feel overwhelming.  
Once paired with other frameworks, it becomes a powerful reference point.
