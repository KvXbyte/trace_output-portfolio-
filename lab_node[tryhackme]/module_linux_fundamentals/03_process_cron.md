# ðŸ§  Processes, Automation & Cron Jobs

## Covered Topics:
- Viewing processes: `ps`, `top`, `htop`
- Managing processes: `kill`, `killall`, `nice`, `renice`
- Using `cron` and `crontab` for automation
- Understanding services with `systemctl` and `service`

## Key Notes:
- Always confirm what youâ€™re killing: `kill -9` is brute force.
- Cron jobs are usefulâ€”but misconfigured ones are an attackerâ€™s dream.
- `systemctl` is more modern than `service` on systemd-based systems.
