# 📁 Linux Navigation & File Management

## Covered Topics:
- Linux directory structure
- Absolute vs relative paths
- Key navigation commands: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
- File operations: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `mkdir`

## Key Notes:
- `ls -la` is a go-to for full detail visibility, including hidden files and permissions.
- Navigating with `cd ..` or `cd ~` helps orient quickly in user and root spaces.
- Always double-check before using `rm -rf` — it's powerful, and unforgiving.

> These basics are the map before the mission. Even in offensive or defensive security, you’re only as good as your navigation instincts.
