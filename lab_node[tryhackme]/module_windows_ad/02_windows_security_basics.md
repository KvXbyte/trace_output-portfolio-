# 🔐 Windows Security Essentials

## Covered Topics:
- User Account Control (UAC)
- Group Policy Objects (GPO)
- Windows Defender overview
- Windows Firewall configuration

## Key Notes:
- UAC prevents unauthorized elevation, but attackers often seek to bypass it.
- GPO can enforce security at scale—useful for managing registry edits, script control, and more.
- Windows Firewall can block unwanted inbound traffic, but misconfigs are common.
