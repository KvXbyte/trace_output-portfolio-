# 💣 Metasploit: Exploitation

This room covers how to use Metasploit to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in target systems.

## 🎯 Topics Covered

- Scanning for open ports and services with `auxiliary/scanner` modules
- Using exploit modules for service-specific vulnerabilities
- Matching compatible payloads to targets
- Gaining interactive shells

## 🛠️ Lab Practice

- Vulnerability chaining: from scan → exploit → shell
- Customizing payloads based on OS/service fingerprinting
- Post-exploitation steps: privilege escalation basics

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

Knowing which exploit to use isn’t enough—understanding module behavior, system response, and payload effect is crucial.
