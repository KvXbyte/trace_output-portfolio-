# 🗂️ Gobuster: Web Enumeration

---

### Covered Topics:

- Discovering hidden files and directories on web servers
- Gobuster wordlists and output modes
- Common HTTP response codes
- Practical enumeration strategy

---

### Key Notes:

- Gobuster uses wordlists to make HTTP requests and identify valid paths.
- 200 and 403 responses are typically of interest—especially if 403 implies access restrictions.
- Directory busting helps identify weak web configurations and exposure risks.
- Web application firewalls (WAFs) may block excessive Gobuster traffic.
