# ðŸ”“ Hydra: Credential Attacks

---

### Covered Topics:

- Hydra installation and syntax
- Brute-forcing login forms (HTTP, SSH, FTP)
- Common Hydra options and modules
- Wordlist usage and basic evasion considerations

---

### Key Notes:

- Hydra is a powerful credential brute-forcer but must be used ethically and legally.
- Command flags like `-L`, `-P`, `-t`, and `-f` control usernames, passwords, threads, and stop-on-success.
- Targeting login services should always involve detection and throttling awareness.
- Hydra shines for training blue teamers to recognize brute force patterns.
