### 1) Overview
This module established the **core networking and web fundamentals** needed for SOC and DFIR work.  
It covered basic LANs, the OSI model, packet structures, and extended into DNS, HTTP, and how websites function as an integrated system.

---

### 2) Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding nodes, IPs, and LAN components  
- Explaining layered communication via the OSI model  
- Analyzing packet and frame structure  
- Recognizing how routers, switches, and VLANs extend networks  
- Deep diving into DNS lookups and common abuse (poisoning/tunneling)  
- Exploring HTTP methods, headers, and request/response cycles  
- Connecting DNS + HTTP + OSI into end-to-end web flows  

---

### 3) Evidence / Artifacts
- THM completion (screenshots / notes)  
- Room-by-room `.md` exports under `module_networking_fundamentals/`  

---

### 4) SOC / DFIR Mappings
- **DNS logs** ‚Üí critical data source for detecting C2, tunneling, exfiltration  
- **HTTP logs** ‚Üí proxy analysis, phishing detection, web exploit trails  
- **OSI model** ‚Üí framework for mapping attacks to specific layers  
- **Packets/Frames** ‚Üí foundational for Wireshark/Tcpdump investigations  

---

### 5) Key Quick-Refs
- OSI layers mnemonic: **All People Seem To Need Data Processing**  
- DNS = domain ‚Üî IP translation; often exploited  
- HTTP verbs: GET (read), POST (submit), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)  
- Packets (L3) vs Frames (L2) distinction  

---

### 6) Reflection
This module reinforced the foundation all SOC and DFIR work rests on.  
DNS and HTTP stood out as especially critical ‚Äî logs from these protocols will drive much of real-world detection and triage.  

---

### 7) Next Actions
- Begin practicing packet capture analysis with **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump**  
- Build a quick-reference ‚Äúlog decoder‚Äù for DNS/HTTP fields  
- Map networking artifacts into upcoming **MITRE ATT&CK** technique studies
