**Source:** `module_exploitation_basics`  
**Tags:** [SOC][DFIR]  
**Status:** Complete • **Last Update:** 2025-09

## 1) Overview
How weaknesses are found and abused (at a defender-safe level): enumeration, misconfig awareness, and common web/app weaknesses.

## 2) Skills Demonstrated
- Host & service enumeration mindset
- Understanding exploit chains and common misconfigs
- Priv-esc awareness and lateral movement indicators

## 3) Evidence / Artifacts
- THM study notes

## 4) SOC / DFIR Mappings
- Detection opportunities across each phase of an intrusion
- Post-compromise artifacts to hunt for (new services, creds use, unusual processes)

## 5) Key Quick-Refs
- Defender lens: map alerts to **MITRE ATT&CK** stages to spot gaps

## 6) Reflection
Seeing how attacks really work sharpens my detection logic and case narratives.

## 7) Next Actions
- Add detection notes to the **edr_sim_logbook**
