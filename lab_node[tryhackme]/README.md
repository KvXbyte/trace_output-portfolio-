# 🧪 lab_node[tryhackme]

This folder contains categorized labs, exports, and module notes based on completed learning paths from **TryHackMe**. Each subfolder represents a structured module focused on foundational skills, specific tools, or real-world scenarios in cybersecurity.

The `module_*` folders hold raw learning notes, lab walkthroughs, and reference material, while polished exports are collected under `completed_rooms`.
