🐧 **Linux Shells (bash/zsh)**

---

### Covered Topics:
- Directory navigation with `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `tree`
- File creation and manipulation: `touch`, `cat`, `nano`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`
- Permissions and user context: `chmod`, `chown`, `whoami`
- Piping and redirection: `|`, `>`, `>>`, `<`
- Process management: `ps`, `kill`, `top`

---

### Key Notes:
- `ls -la` shows all files including hidden ones, plus permissions and ownership.
- Use `chmod +x script.sh` to make a script executable.
- Combine commands with pipes (e.g., `cat file.txt | grep "admin"`) for fast filtering.
- `sudo` is powerful—double-check your intent before hitting enter.
