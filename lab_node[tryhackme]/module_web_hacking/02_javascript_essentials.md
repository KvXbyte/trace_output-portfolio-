# ðŸ“œ JavaScript Essentials

**Focus:** JS behavior, DOM interaction, basic scripting vulnerabilities

---

## ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts

- JS modifies HTML/DOM dynamically
- Input fields can be manipulated by user-injected scripts
- `document.cookie`, `innerHTML`, and DOM access vectors
- Intro to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) behaviors

## ðŸ§ª Observations

- Dynamic form fields can become easy XSS targets
- JS debugging tools like the browser dev console are helpful for testing payloads
