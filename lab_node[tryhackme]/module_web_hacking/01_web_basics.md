# 🌐 Web Application Basics

**Focus:** HTTP, URLs, requests/responses, headers, status codes

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

- HTTP Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- URL structure: protocol, domain, path, parameters
- Response status codes: `200`, `301`, `403`, `404`, `500`
- Headers: `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, `Host`, `Content-Type`

---

## 🧠 Notes

Understanding HTTP is foundational to any web security analysis. Every vulnerability starts with how data flows between the browser and the server. Mastering requests, responses, and headers helps with later exploitation and detection.

## 🧪 Observations

- Many web apps expose internal logic via headers and status codes.
- Misconfigured servers often leak too much detail in error responses.
