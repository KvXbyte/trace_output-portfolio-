## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator is a web-based tool for exploring, annotating, and visualizing the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
It provides a flexible way to map detection coverage, track adversary behaviors, and prioritize defenses.

---

## ðŸ§° Key Features
- Interactive ATT&CK matrices (Enterprise, ICS, Mobile)  
- Ability to create custom layers and heat maps  
- Export/Import JSON layers for sharing coverage models  
- Collaboration features for team-based analysis  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters (DFIR Use Case)
- Helps analysts connect logs, detections, and IOCs to ATT&CK techniques  
- Visualizes coverage gaps and overlaps in detection strategy  
- Provides a framework to align incident response to adversary behaviors  

---

## ðŸ“’ Notes
The Navigator is widely used in SOCs and by threat hunters for mapping detection and reporting.  
Works best when paired with tools like Sigma or Splunk to translate rules into ATT&CK coverage.
