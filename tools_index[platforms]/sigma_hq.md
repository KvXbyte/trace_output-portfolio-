## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Sigma is an open, community-driven generic signature format for SIEM systems.  
It allows analysts to write detection rules in a standardized way, then convert them into queries for Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel, and more.

---

## ðŸ§° Key Features
- Detection-as-code with YAML-based rule format  
- Wide community support and contributions  
- Tools like **sigmac** convert Sigma rules into SIEM queries  
- Rules often mapped to MITRE ATT&CK  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters (DFIR Use Case)
- Analysts can share and reuse detection rules across platforms  
- Provides a structured, human-readable format for detections  
- Helps bridge the gap between CTI (threat intel) and SIEM queries  

---

## ðŸ“’ Notes
Often used alongside SOC Prime TDM.  
Great starting point for learning how detections are built and tuned.
