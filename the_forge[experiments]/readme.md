# 🔥 the_forge[experiments]

A personal workshop for cybersecurity experiments and hands-on projects.  
Unlike `lab_node[tryhackme]` (structured training modules), this space is dedicated to **self-built scenarios**, tool experiments, and proof-of-work projects.  

---

## 🧪 Purpose
- Practice with real-world tools used in SOC & DFIR (Autopsy, Volatility, Splunk, Wireshark, etc.)  
- Build custom scenarios (phishing investigations, malware analysis, log analysis, memory dumps).  
- Document workflows for personal growth and portfolio proof.  

---

## 🗂️ Structure
Each experiment will have its own subfolder:  

- `exp_[name]` → A focused scenario (e.g., `exp_phishing-analysis`)  
- Each folder may include:  
  - `notes.md` → Documentation, commands, and findings  
  - Screenshots, logs, or artifacts (as appropriate)  
  - References or detection rules used  

---

## ⚙️ Planned Experiments
- **Phishing Email Investigation** → Analyze headers, attachments, and indicators  
- **Memory Dump Analysis** → Use Volatility to identify malicious processes  
- **Suspicious Traffic Capture** → Investigate a PCAP with Wireshark/tcpdump  
- **Log Hunting with Splunk** → Write queries to detect unusual activity  
- **Malware Sandbox Test** (future/optional) → Safe environment for static/dynamic analysis  

---

## 📒 Notes
This folder is intentionally experimental.  
Not every project will be polished, but each one reflects progress in learning **DFIR workflows** and **incident response analysis**.
