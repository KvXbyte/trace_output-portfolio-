# ðŸ§  challenge_writeups

This folder is reserved for technical notes and documented solutions from individual cybersecurity challenges.  
This may include TryHackMe-specific tasks, custom CTFs, puzzle rooms, or standalone labs not tied to a full module.

Entries here will:
- Include step-by-step breakdowns
- Explain logic behind commands or payloads
- Emphasize lessons learned over just answers

> Challenges arenâ€™t just solvedâ€”theyâ€™re documented, deconstructed, and demystified.
