# 📓 log_entry[writeups]

This node contains **structured cybersecurity writeups**, grouped into two main categories:  

- **🧩 Challenge Writeups** → Hands-on challenge/lab breakdowns (TryHackMe, CTFs, scenario labs)  
- **🚨 Incident Reports** → Simulated or real-case narratives following an incident response structure  

Each entry reinforces technical skills, storytelling clarity, and the ability to document investigations for SOC/DFIR workflows.
