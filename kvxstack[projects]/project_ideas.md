# ðŸ’¡ Project Ideas

A running list of concepts, tools, and experiments Iâ€™d like to build or explore in the future.

## ðŸš€ Potential Projects

- Splunk dashboard to visualize brute-force login attempts
- Script to parse logs and extract IOCs into CSV format
- Utility to compare known-good baseline configs against live data
- Lightweight CLI tool for quick port scanning
- Threat feed ingestion into Splunk using API integrations

*This list will grow and evolve as I learn and experiment.*
