## 📝 Notes
- Each plan is both a **roadmap** (forward-looking) and **artifact** (shows structured growth).  
- Security+ has been completed; others are in progress or planned.  
- This progression demonstrates readiness for **SOC Analyst → DFIR → Advanced Incident Response**.  
- “Every plan is a blueprint. Execution builds the foundation.”
