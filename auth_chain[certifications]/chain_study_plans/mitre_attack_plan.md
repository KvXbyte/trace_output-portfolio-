**Status:** 🟡 Planned — Early Development

## Focus Areas
- Tactics → Adversary objectives (Initial Access → Impact)  
- Techniques → Specific attacker behaviors (e.g., T1547.001, Timestomping)  
- Mapping ATT&CK → Unified Kill Chain & Diamond Model  
- Detection engineering & correlation with SIEM

## Resources
- MITRE ATT&CK official Navigator  
- Red Canary “Threat Detection Report”  
- TryHackMe Cyber Defence Frameworks module  
- DFIR Report and Atomic Red Team

## Timeline
- **Start:** Post-CySA+  
- **Target:** Begin structured mappings Q1 2026

## Notes
ATT&CK is the **universal reference language** for detection and response.  
This plan connects my GitHub `tactic_map[mitre-attack]` folder with real-world mappings and DFIR analysis.
