# 🧭 certification_roadmap.md

This roadmap reflects my tactical cybersecurity path—focused on detection, response, and real-world defensive operations without relying on deep programming knowledge.

Certifications are chosen based on their **practical application**, **tool alignment**, and **career relevance**—not for clout or vanity stacking. I prioritize opportunities that strengthen my hands-on experience, reinforce my Purple Team foundation, and increase my long-term value as a SOC analyst or detection-focused defender.

## ✅ For Sure — Actively Pursuing or Fully Planned

### 🔐 **CompTIA CySA+** *(in progress)*  
- **Phase:** Mid-2025  
- **Path:** Deepening detection and analysis skills  
- **Focus:** Threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management  
- **Purpose:** Core SOC and Purple Team capabilities

### 📊 **Splunk Core Certified Power User**  
- **Phase:** Late 2025  
- **Path:** Mastery of Splunk search, dashboards, and knowledge objects  
- **Focus:** SIEM, log analysis, operational efficiency  
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate real-world analyst workflow and SIEM fluency

## 🟡 Most Likely — Aligned with Strengths and Workflow

### 🧪 **TryHackMe Red Team/Purple Modules**  
- **Phase:** Ongoing  
- **Path:** Tactical exploration of attack simulation and credential testing  
- **Focus:** Hydra, Burp Suite, password cracking, emulated adversary techniques  
- **Why:** No programming required; matches hands-on workflow and Purple Team learning

## 🔷 Considering / Open for Future Alignment

### 🐧 **CompTIA Linux+**  
- **Status:** Under consideration  
- **Path:** Validating existing Linux comfort with a formal credential  
- **Focus:** System hardening, user permissions, kernel & services  
- **Why:** Natural fit based on CLI strength; potential easy win for portfolio strength

### 💥 **CompTIA PenTest+**  
- **Status:** Open to future exploration  
- **Path:** Structured offensive intro if later needed for Purple Team expansion  
- **Focus:** Vulnerability scanning, exploitation flow, reporting  
- **Why:** Not a current priority, but possibly helpful in a hybrid detection/response role

### ❓ **eJPT / eJPTv2** *(Undecided)*  
- **Status:** Passive interest; not actively pursuing  
- **Path:** Hands-on Red Team cert with less coding than OSCP  
- **Focus:** Recon, enumeration, exploitation with practical labs  
- **Why:** Flagged by peers as accessible; may explore later if aligned with role evolution

## 📎 Notes

- This roadmap supports a **Purple Team mindset**: combining detection, understanding of attacker behavior, and system-level control.
- Preference is given to **low-code**, **Linux-friendly**, and **analyst-relevant** certifications.
- Certifications will be selected only when they **add measurable value** to real-world capability, job relevance, or strategic career positioning.
