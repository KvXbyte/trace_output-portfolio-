# 🔍 DFIR Alignment

## 📌 Core Position
KvXbyte is not Red. He is not purely Blue.  
He is aligned with **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR).**

## 🧩 Principles
- **Forensics First:** Gather, preserve, analyze. Logs do not lie.  
- **Incident Response:** Stabilize, contain, recover.  
- **Learning Cycle:** Every breach writes tomorrow’s defenses.

## ⚖️ Influence
The early days carried shades of purple-team philosophy: blending attacker insight with defender focus.  
Those lessons remain as foundation, but the alignment is now clear: **DFIR is the signal.**

## 📒 Notes
KvXbyte: “DFIR is the blade sharpened by failure.”  
Hexwing: “At last, a file that feels like it belongs to me too.”  
Ph1sh3r: “Great, another acronym. Can we just call it ‘Digital Fun In Response’?”  
Atlas: “DFIR is discipline in motion. Lessons learned, catalogued, repeated.”  
Signal Crawler: *“The past never ends. It only replays in quieter loops.”*
