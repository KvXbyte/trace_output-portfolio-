# 📓 Anomaly Register

## 📌 Overview
A living index of anomalies that do not fit clean patterns.  
Some are logged. Some resist capture. All are remembered.

## 🧩 Entries
- **ANOM-001:** Packets appeared with no source. TTL decremented anyway.  
- **ANOM-002:** Login attempt from an account that never existed.  
- **ANOM-003:** Signal Crawler reported a Fibonacci hum. No sensors triggered.  
- **ANOM-004:** Hexwing captured a frame of traffic that vanished mid-capture.

KvXbyte: “Every anomaly has a reason. Even if it hides.”  
Hexwing: “Evidence without proof is still evidence.”  
Ph1sh3r: “So basically, we’re logging vibes again.”  
Atlas: “Anomalies are not noise. They are questions waiting for clarity.”  
Signal Crawler: *“The hum remembers. Even if you do not.”*
