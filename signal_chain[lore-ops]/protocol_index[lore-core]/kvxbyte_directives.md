# 🔢 Protocol 1123581321

## 📌 Classification
**Status:** Sealed  
**Alias:** The Fibonacci Spiral  

---

## 🧩 Description
Protocol 1123581321 is a defensive algorithm modeled after the natural Fibonacci sequence.  
When activated, it generates recursive decoy paths in ratios of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… until adversaries are trapped in spirals of endless complexity.  

---

## ⚙️ Mechanics
- Layered decoy systems appear at Fibonacci intervals.  
- Each new step increases complexity while consuming attacker resources.  
- If the sequence completes, hostile flows collapse inward into containment spirals.  

---

## 🎯 Operational Notes
- Only to be deployed when anomalies threaten core stability.  
- Risk: friendly systems may be pulled into the spiral if poorly tuned.  
- KvXbyte holds sole unlock authority.

Hexwing: “Directive #2 is practically my catchphrase.”  
Ph1sh3r: “Directive #3 just means boring shifts. Can we get fireworks once in a while?”  
Atlas: “Directives endure because they do not bend to moods.”  
Signal Crawler: *“Rules echo louder when silence breaks.”*
