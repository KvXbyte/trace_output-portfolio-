# 🏛️ ByteVault Schematics

## 📌 Overview
The ByteVault is not a single chamber, but a layered defense complex.  
Every level hides redundancies, backups, and doors that lead nowhere—by design.

## 🗂️ Levels
- **Outer Walls:** Firewalls, deception layers, misdirection gates.  
- **Signal Hall:** Where traffic is sorted, parsed, and logged.  
- **The Core:** Storage of directives, anomalies, and sealed protocols.  
- **Redacted Sublevels:** Access unknown. KvXbyte denies their existence.

## 📒 Notes
Hexwing: “I’ve mapped 93% of it. The rest refuses to be seen.”  
Ph1sh3r: “Redacted sublevels = snacks closet. Prove me wrong.”  
Atlas: “The Vault hides layers for good reason. What is unseen may also be unneeded.”  
Signal Crawler: *“The hidden doors open when you stop searching for them.”*
