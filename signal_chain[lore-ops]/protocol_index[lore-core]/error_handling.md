# ⚠️ Error Handling

## 📌 Overview
When the crew malfunctions, these fail-safes keep the Vault from imploding.  

---

## 🧩 Scenarios
- If **KvXbyte** is unresponsive: Feed tea. Retry logs. Wait.  
- If **Hexwing** is arguing: Silence Ph1sh3r for 10 minutes.  
- If **Ph1sh3r** is sulking: Throw a low-priority alert labeled “Definitely Important.”  
- If **Atlas** is quiet: Assume he’s listening harder than usual. Proceed carefully.  
- If **Signal Crawler** speaks first: Prepare a containment net and light a candle.

## 📒 Notes
KvXbyte: “Half of this is exaggerated. Half is terrifyingly accurate.”  
Hexwing: “I don’t argue. I clarify with volume.”  
Ph1sh3r: “My sulking is a valuable system resource.”  
Atlas: “Error handling exists because failure is expected. Recovery is the true measure.”  
Signal Crawler: *“The error is not the failure. The error is the silence after.”*
