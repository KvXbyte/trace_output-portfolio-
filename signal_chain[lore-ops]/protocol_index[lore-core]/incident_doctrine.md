# 🛡️ Incident Doctrine

## 📌 Overview
Every anomaly deserves structure. KvXbyte’s doctrine outlines the cycle of response:  
**Detect → Triage → Contain → Clarify → Document.**

---

## 🧩 Phases
1. **Detect**  
   - Trust the logs. Trust the sensors. Listen when the noise changes.  

2. **Triage**  
   - Verify scope, prioritize by impact, and silence false echoes.  

3. **Contain**  
   - Isolate, restrict, and scatter adversaries before damage spreads.  

4. **Clarify**  
   - Reconstruct the trail, align evidence, identify root cause.  

5. **Document**  
   - Logs are history. History is memory. Memory prevents repetition.

## 📒 Notes
KvXbyte: “Without doctrine, chaos wins.”  
Hexwing: “I approve of step 5. Documentation is my weapon.”  
Ph1sh3r: “Step 6 should be ‘complain loudly.’ Just saying.”  
Atlas: “Doctrine survives because it scales from noise to silence.”  
Signal Crawler: *“The pattern hums before the doctrine speaks.”*
