## 🧩 Entries
- **INC-000:** The first recorded intrusion. Logs fragmented, but the breach ended in containment.  
- **INC-004:** A false positive so convincing it nearly rewrote directives.  
- **INC-007:** Ph1sh3r’s first detection. He hasn’t stopped bragging since.  
- **INC-011:** Evidence of external transmissions. Archived for lack of proof.
