# 🗂️ relic_node[archive]

A digital graveyard for alternate timelines, failed story drafts, or lore ideas too weird even for Ph1sh3r.

This is where you store the “maybe” content—non-canon, overwritten, or experimental pieces that still have value (or comedy). Who knows? One of these may get recompiled into future reality.

## 🕳️ Warning

Contents may contain:
- Rejected KvXbyte names
