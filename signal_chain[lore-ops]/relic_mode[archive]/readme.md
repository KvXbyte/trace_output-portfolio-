# 🗄️ relic_node[archive]

The forgotten shelf of the ByteVault.  
Here lie the files that shaped us once, but now rest in silence.  
Deprecated doctrines, failed protocols, and logs too old to act on—but too important to erase.  

---

## 🗂️ Files

### ✅ Existing
- [**purple_team_notes.md**](./purple_team_notes.md) — The early balance between Red and Blue, archived as history.  
- [**ghost_protocols.md**](./ghost_protocols.md) — Unfinished, unstable protocols. Dangerous if reawakened.  
- [**old_incidents.md**](./old_incidents.md) — Archived logs of early breaches that shaped doctrine.  

---

### 🔮 Coming Soon
- `deprecated_tools.md` — Systems we once trusted, now discarded.  
- `signal_fragments.md` — Stray transmissions of unknown origin.  
- `lost_doctrines.md` — Draft philosophies that never became law.
