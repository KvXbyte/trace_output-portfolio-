# 📡 signal_chain[lore-ops]

Welcome to the signal beneath the surface—where logs become stories and systems whisper secrets.  
This branch of the KvXbyte repository is the **narrative core**.  

Here, technical concepts are wrapped in fiction, field notes are encrypted as logs, and AI assistants are just as moody as their human counterparts.  
Some files teach, some files taunt, and some should probably stay sealed.  

Use this chain for creative output, professional storytelling, or just as a reminder that cybersecurity doesn’t have to be dry.
