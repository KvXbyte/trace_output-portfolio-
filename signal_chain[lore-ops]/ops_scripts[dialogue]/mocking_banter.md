**[16:00] Ph1sh3r:** Another false positive. Alert fatigue is my cardio.  

**[16:01] Echo:** *beep-bop* (Translation: maybe if you ran more queries instead of your mouth, we’d finish faster.)  

**[16:02] Ph1sh3r:** Oh wow, the tin can grew teeth.  

**[16:03] Echo:** *bip-bip-beep* (Correction: sharper than your logic, duller than your wit. Which isn’t saying much.)  

**[16:04] Ph1sh3r:** Excuse me? I’m the sarcastic one here. That’s *my* bit.  

**[16:05] Echo:** *beep* (And now it’s *my* bit. Adapt or uninstall.)  

**[16:06] Ph1sh3r:** KvXbyte, tell your drone to stay in its lane.  

**[16:07] KvXbyte:** I would, but honestly? I’ve been waiting for someone to roast you back. Carry on.  

**[16:08] Echo:** *beep-bop* (Victory noise.)  

**[16:09] Ph1sh3r:** Yeah, yeah. Just don’t start logging stand-up routines.  

**[16:10] Echo:** *beep* (Already drafted. Title: “How Many Analysts Does It Take to Close a Ticket?”)
