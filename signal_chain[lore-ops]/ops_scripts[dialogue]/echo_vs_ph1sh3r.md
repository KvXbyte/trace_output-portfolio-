**[00:00] KvXbyte:** Status?

**[00:01] Echo:** *beep-beep—boop* (Translation: IDS ping. Low severity. Relax.)

**[00:02] Ph1sh3r:** “Relax,” he says. Last time you said relax, we spent four hours chasing a printer.

**[00:03] Echo:** *beep?* (It *was* exfiltrating PDFs to a mystery share named `PRINT-DESTINY`.)

**[00:04] Ph1sh3r:** Destiny had terrible ACLs.

**[00:05] KvXbyte:** Focus. Is this an alert or a vibe?

**[00:06] Echo:** *beep-beep* (YARA hit on attachment name pattern—phishy—but hash is clean.)

**[00:07] Ph1sh3r:** Oh good, Schrödinger’s payload. It’s both benign *and* annoying.

**[00:08] KvXbyte:** Pull headers, enrich domain, tag ticket as “triage:light.”  

**[00:09] Echo:** *bip* (Headers uploaded.)  

**[00:10] Ph1sh3r:** If it turns out to be a newsletter, I’m filing a complaint with Marketing’s thesaurus.

**[00:11] KvXbyte:** If it turns out to be a phish, I’m filing a complaint with your attitude.

**[00:12] Ph1sh3r:** Bold of you to assume I take feedback.
