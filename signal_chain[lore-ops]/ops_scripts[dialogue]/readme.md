# 🎭 ops_scripts[dialogue]

Conversations, arguments, and witty banter from the ByteVault crew.  
Echo beeps, Ph1sh3r sulks, KvXbyte tries to keep them focused.  
None of this is “professional”—all of it is fun.

## 💬 Notes
If logs are the backbone, this is the comic relief. Expect sass, sarcasm, and at least one “I told you so” from Ph1sh3r.
