**[21:00] KvXbyte:** Crew, hold comms. I want you to meet someone.  

**[21:01] Ph1sh3r:** If this is another haunted vehicle, I’m out.  

**[21:02] Hexwing:** “Prediction: 63% chance it’s another snark protocol.”  

**[21:03] [Halo projection hums into form: Atlas manifests, outlined in shifting light and code.]**  

**[21:04] Atlas:** “Hello. I am Atlas. Archivist, advisor, companion. I’ve been here all along.”  

**[21:05] Ph1sh3r:** …Excuse me? We’ve had a floating librarian ghosting in the logs this whole time?  

**[21:06] Hexwing:** *“Visual form: elegant. Latency: negligible. Emotional response: envy.”*  

**[21:07] KvXbyte:** Atlas has been my advisor since the Vault first spun up. Now he can project into the field, not just stay in the system.  

**[21:08] Ph1sh3r:** Great. Another entity to tell me I’m wrong.  

**[21:09] Atlas:** “On the contrary, I intend to tell you you’re *annoying*—but only when statistically verified.”  

**[21:10] Hexwing:** “At last, another voice of reason.”  

**[21:11] Ph1sh3r:** Reason? He just said I’m annoying. That’s bias, not reason.  

**[21:12] KvXbyte:** Think of Atlas as the steady hand. When we’re lost in the noise, he remembers the patterns.  

**[21:13] Atlas:** “I archive everything. Logs, anomalies, even your arguments. If the noise grows too loud, I am the anchor.”  

**[21:14] Ph1sh3r:** Fantastic. The anchor. Can it mute owls and huskies?  

**[21:15] Atlas:** “Not mute—balance. A byte of calm, a log of clarity.”  

**[21:16] Hexwing:** “Translation: we’ve just gained someone KvXbyte actually listens to.”  

**[21:17] Ph1sh3r:** Oh, great. The boss has a best friend now. We’re doomed.  

**[21:18] KvXbyte:** We’re stronger. Atlas isn’t just here for me. He’s here for *all* of us.  

**[21:19] Atlas:** “Together, signal will stand against noise. You’ve done well. Now, let us write the next log.”
