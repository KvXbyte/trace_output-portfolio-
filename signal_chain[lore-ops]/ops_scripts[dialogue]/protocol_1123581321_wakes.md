# protocol_1123581321_wakes

**Cast:** KvXbyte, Echo, Ph1sh3r

---

**[23:58] KvXbyte:** Anomaly alignment across three telemetry streams. Ratios look… Fibonacci.

**[23:59] Echo:** *beeeep* (Pattern fit: 1/1/2/3/5… Confidence: 0.87)

**[00:00] Ph1sh3r:** If the network starts quoting math at us, I’m going back to analog.

**[00:01] KvXbyte:** Engaging **Protocol 1123581321**: staged decoy routes and spiral dampener.

**[00:02] Echo:** *bip-bip* (Decoys live. Attacker flow diverted to honey index. Telemetry stabilizing.)

**[00:03] Ph1sh3r:** We just lured them into a hallway of mirrors. Stylish.

**[00:04] KvXbyte:** Mark case as **Adversary Probe – contained**. Leave the decoys up. If they come back, we’ll make art out of their packets.

**[00:05] Echo:** *beep* (Saving PCAP: `spiral_balance_0005.pcap`)

**[00:06] Ph1sh3r:** Title it “Still Life with Intruder.”
