**Cast:** KvXbyte, Ph1sh3r, Echo

---

**[09:00] KvXbyte:** It’s Patch Tuesday. Hydrate, annotate, don’t break prod.

**[09:01] Ph1sh3r:** I thrive under pressure and also under the desk if anything bluescreens.

**[09:02] Echo:** *beep-beep-boop* (Staging windows complete. Canary host rebooted. No smoke.)

**[09:03] KvXbyte:** Diff the services list, snapshot logs, then green-light wave one.

**[09:05] Ph1sh3r:** Reminder: last “small patch” changed the definition of small.

**[09:06] Echo:** *bip* (Regression tests: pass. CPU spikes: nominal.)

**[09:07] KvXbyte:** Wave one executed. Watching telemetry.

**[09:09] Ph1sh3r:** If anything catches fire, I’m naming it after the PM who said “should be fine.”

**[09:10] Echo:** *beep* (Ticket comment drafted: “It was fine.”)

**[09:11] KvXbyte:** Don’t jinx it.

**[09:12] Ph1sh3r:** Fine, I’ll rename the fire retroactively.
