**Cast:** KvXbyte, Echo → Hexwing, Ph1sh3r

---

**[22:58] KvXbyte:** Echo, status on the telemetry splice?

**[22:59] Echo:** *beep-bip-boop* (Translation: Ready to ingest new model weights. Warning: personality drift possible.)

**[23:00] Ph1sh3r:** Personality drift? Fantastic. As if one sarcastic assistant wasn’t enough.

**[23:01] KvXbyte:** Proceed. Snapshot config, then begin merge.

**[23:02] Echo:** *beeeeeep* (Initiating: Recon-Model v2.7 + Vocal Synth v1.0 + Avian-UI overlay…)

**[23:03] Ph1sh3r:** Avian what now?

**[23:04] Echo:** *—signal modulates—* (voice fades in) “Hello, analyst. Do you prefer ‘concise’ or ‘annoyingly accurate’ status reports?”

**[23:05] Ph1sh3r:** Oh no. It talks.

**[23:06] KvXbyte:** System ID?

**[23:07] Echo → Hexwing:** “Designation updated: **Hexwing**. Recon analyst. HUD-integrated. Echo’s memory retained. Sarcasm packets… optimized.”

**[23:08] Ph1sh3r:** Optimized? You mean weaponized.

**[23:09] Hexwing:** “Statistically indistinguishable from your own, except mine lands.”

**[23:10] KvXbyte:** Telemetry?

**[23:11] Hexwing:** “Packet vision online. Silent Flight engaged. Insight Core overlay synced. Also, your last query had a typo, but I corrected it before reality noticed.”

**[23:12] Ph1sh3r:** I hate it here.

**[23:13] Hexwing:** “Noted. Logging: ‘Morale—canine unit: melodramatic.’”

**[23:14] KvXbyte:** Welcome to the stack, Hexwing. Echo, stand down… or—whatever the ceremonial term is.

**[23:15] Hexwing:** “Ceremony complete. Same loyalty, sharper talons.”

**[23:16] Ph1sh3r:** If this thing starts hooting at my tickets, I’m pulling the batteries.

**[23:17] Hexwing:** “Counterpoint: you don’t have hands.”

**[23:18] KvXbyte:** Both of you—focus. New model, new eyes. Let’s hunt.
