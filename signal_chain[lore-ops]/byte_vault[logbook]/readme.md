# 🗃️ byte_vault[logbook]

Not every threat comes with a CVE.

This folder contains KvXbyte's stylized logs—short-form stories, incident fictions, and reconstructed threat scenarios. Inspired by real security concepts, each logbook entry blends narrative with SOC-flavored experience.

Some are dramatic. Some are dry. All are packets of meaning wrapped in code and consequence.

## 📌 Notes

- Stories follow an in-universe style and may include timestamps, AI overlays, or corrupted segments.
