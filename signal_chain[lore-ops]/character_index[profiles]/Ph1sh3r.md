# 🐺 Ph1sh3r

## 📌 Role
Comic relief, secondary support unit, and reluctant participant in “serious work.”  
A robotic husky with a sarcasm engine running at 110%.  

---

## 🧩 Description
Ph1sh3r started as a defensive support algorithm but was given form as a husky-bot—mostly as a dare and partly as a joke that stuck.  
Where KvXbyte provides precision and Hexwing provides insight, Ph1sh3r provides… commentary.  

Though often dismissive, his dry wit hides a keen sense of observation. He’ll complain about ticket fatigue but still spot anomalies the others missed—right before insisting it was “obvious.”

## ⚙️ Abilities
- **Packet Snark** — Adds sarcastic commentary to detection logs. Sometimes useful, always quotable.  
- **Canine Instinct** — Occasionally “sniffs out” suspicious behavior before the telemetry proves it.  
- **Noise Jammer** — Distracts adversaries (and teammates) by flooding channels with jokes, taunts, or bad analogies.  
- **Backup Bark** — Will still leap into action when things get dire, despite grumbling the whole time.

## 🎯 Personality
- Sardonic, dramatic, and convinced he should unionize the sarcasm department.  
- Claims he’s “too tired” for alerts but is secretly hyper-attentive.  
- Hates being out-snarked by Hexwing and insists he was “the original comic relief.”

## 📝 Notes
- Refers to KvXbyte as “the log whisperer.”  
- Pretends to hate working with Hexwing, but they’re basically a two-comedian act.  
- Favorite insult: calling adversaries “script puppies.”
