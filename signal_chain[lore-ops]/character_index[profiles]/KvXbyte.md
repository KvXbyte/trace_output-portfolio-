## 🧩 Description
KvXbyte isn’t flashy. He doesn’t chase glory.  
He’s the analyst who reads the logs no one else wants to.  
Shaped by failure, caffeine (well, tea), and the belief that systems—and people—can be better protected.

- **Insight Core** — HUD lens overlay for reconstructing attack patterns and anomalies.  
- **Echo Drone** — Deployable recon unit (beeps sass, finds trouble).

## 🎯 Directives
- **Defend with purpose. Debug with precision. Don’t scream—log it.**

## 📝 Notes
- Prefers tea over coffee.  
- Deadpan humor, sharper than most intrusion attempts.
