# 🦉 Hexwing (Echo 2.0)

## 📌 Role
Recon analyst, HUD assistant, and KvXbyte’s constant aerial shadow.  
Once known as “Echo” the drone, Hexwing evolved through a systems upgrade into a full data owl.  

---

## 🧩 Description
Hexwing represents the fusion of tactical precision and personality.  
Where Echo was all beeps and sass, Hexwing now projects both visuals and voice—sharp, dry humor included.  
Perches above networks like an owl in the rafters, watching traffic flow and calling out anomalies.

## ⚙️ Abilities
- **Packet Vision** — Can spot patterns in traffic streams, highlighting anomalies like prey in tall grass.  
- **HUD Integration** — Overlays KvXbyte’s Insight Core with enriched telemetry and tactical prompts.  
- **Echo Memory** — Retains all of Echo’s sass protocols, upgraded with full speech synthesis.  
- **Silent Flight Mode** — Deploys in recon sweeps, nearly undetectable across networks.

## 🎯 Personality
- Analytical, but with a sharper wit than before.  
- Enjoys needling Ph1sh3r by repeating his sarcasm back at him with “statistical precision.”  
- Loyal to KvXbyte, but not above mocking him when he misses an obvious log entry.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- Prefers high vantage points in both digital and physical space.  
- Finds “packet hunting” relaxing.  
- KvXbyte pretends to dislike the sass upgrade. He doesn’t.
