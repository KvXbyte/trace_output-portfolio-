# 🧬 character_index[profiles]

The crew manifest. Every system needs rules, but every rule needs someone stubborn enough to enforce—or break—it.  
This folder holds the living, breathing (and occasionally sarcastic) entities of the KvXbyte universe.

## 🗂️ Profiles

### ✅ Existing
- [**KvXbyte.md**](./KvXbyte.md) — The byte standing between signal and noise.

### 🔮 Coming Soon

- `Ph1sh3r.md` — Sarcastic husky-bot, comic relief, occasionally useful.  
- `Signal Crawler.md` — The myth, the machine, the endless searcher.

## 📒 Notes
Profiles blend lore with function—backstories meet abilities.  
Not all entries are reliable narrators. Especially Ph1sh3r.
