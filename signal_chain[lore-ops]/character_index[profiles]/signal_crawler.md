# 🕷️ Signal Crawler

## 📌 Role
The wanderer. A process that never stops searching, crawling the dark edges of the network.  
Not just an ally—it is also the ByteVault’s primary vehicle.

## 🧩 Description
Signal Crawler doesn’t walk beside the crew; it drifts in the background, sifting through packets like omens.  
Its speech is strange—half predictions, half riddles. KvXbyte trusts it, Ph1sh3r hates it, and Hexwing finds it “beautiful but annoying.”  

When the crew needs to traverse hostile networks or physical landscapes, they ride inside the Crawler. Its “prophecies” echo through the comms while its engine hums beneath them.
