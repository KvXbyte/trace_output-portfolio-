🧭 certification_roadmap.md  

This roadmap reflects my tactical cybersecurity path—focused on detection, DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response), and real-world defensive operations without relying on deep programming knowledge.  

Certifications are chosen based on their practical application, tool alignment, and career relevance—not for clout or vanity stacking. I prioritize opportunities that strengthen my hands-on experience, reinforce my Purple Team foundation, and increase my long-term value as a SOC analyst, forensic responder, or detection-focused defender.
