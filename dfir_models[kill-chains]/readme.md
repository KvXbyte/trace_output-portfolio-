# ðŸ”Ž DFIR Models â€” Kill Chains & Analysis Frameworks

This directory houses frameworks used to model adversary behavior and guide incident response.  
Unlike `tactic_map[mitre-attack]`, which catalogs techniques, these frameworks structure **attack progression** and **analysis narratives**.

---

## ðŸ“š Included Frameworks
- [Cyber Kill Chain](./cyber_kill_chain) â†’ Classic 7-step intrusion model  
- [Unified Kill Chain](./unified_kill_chain) â†’ Extended model with more granular phases  
- [Diamond Model](./diamond_model) â†’ Relational model of adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim  

---

## ðŸ”— Usage
- Map ATT&CK techniques to kill chain phases  
- Use Diamond Model to pivot investigations and connect adversary behaviors  
- Build DFIR case studies with both chronological (Kill Chain) and relational (Diamond) perspectives  

---

## ðŸ“Ž Cross-References
- See [`../tactic_map[mitre-attack]`](../tactic_map[mitre-attack]) for ATT&CK mappings
