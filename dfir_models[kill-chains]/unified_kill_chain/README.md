# 🔄 Unified Kill Chain (UKC)

**Purpose:**  
An evolution of the Cyber Kill Chain that merges **intrusion & campaign phases** into a broader model.  
It provides a more detailed end-to-end view of adversary operations.

## 📚 Key Phases (examples)
- Reconnaissance  
- Initial Access  
- Execution  
- Persistence  
- Privilege Escalation  
- Defense Evasion  
- Credential Access  
- Discovery  
- Lateral Movement  
- Collection  
- Command & Control  
- Exfiltration  
- Impact

## 🔗 SOC / DFIR Relevance
- Encourages defenders to map **detections** across the full lifecycle.  
- More granular than the Cyber Kill Chain, closer in spirit to MITRE ATT&CK.  
- Useful for building detection playbooks and case narratives.

---

## 📝 Notes
- Strong for **blue team** planning and purple-team collaboration.  
- Works best when cross-referenced with ATT&CK techniques.  
- Already seeded in GitHub: mapping examples (T1547.001 persistence, Timestomping evasion).
